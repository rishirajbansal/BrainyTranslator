# BrainyTranslator
### A Natural Language Based Brainy Translator

#### Overview
A text translation application that uses advanced machine learning technologies to provide high-quality translation to translate raw text or unstructured text documents in multiple languages.

It provides translation between a source language (the input language) and a target language (the output language). It uses semantic representation to generate a translation one word at a time.

Itâ€™s a great solution in cases where the volume of text is high, speed is critical, and very minor level of translation imperfection is acceptable.
