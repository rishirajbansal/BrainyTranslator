### Overview
A text translation application that uses advanced machine learning technologies to provide high-quality translation to translate raw text or unstructured text documents in multiple languages.

It provides translation between a source language (the input language) and a target language (the output language). It uses semantic representation to generate a translation one word at a time.

Itâ€™s a great solution in cases where the volume of text is high, speed is critical, and very minor level of translation imperfection is acceptable. 

### Architectural Design
This section elucidates the overall architectural design of the system with the brief description of the progression flow among the systems and the interfaces involved in the program. 

The architecture of the system is based on MVC and SOA design principles.
